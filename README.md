# VcCoop

- VcCoop is simple application for collecting statistics of players from server on cooperative mode


### Plans
- Add command for check the player info like, perfects, success and failed missions, average play time etc..
- Add command for check map status like how many times map was played, how many % was perfect, success or failed, and average play time.
- Add HTTP API to be able to connect VcCoop to website (or probably i can use SQL)
